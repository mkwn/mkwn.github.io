<p>There are a number of well-known problems and conjectures about partitioning graphs to satisfy local constraints. For example, the <em>majority colouring conjecture</em> of Kreutzer, Oum, Seymour, van der Zypen and Wood states that every directed graph has a 3-colouring such that for every vertex <i>v</i>, at most half of the out-neighbours of <i>v</i> have the same colour as <i>v</i>. As another example, the <em>internal partition conjecture</em>, due to DeVos and to Ban and Linial, states that for every <i>d</i>, all but finitely many <i>d</i>-regular graphs have a partition into two nonempty parts such that for every vertex <i>v</i>, at least half of the neighbours of <i>v</i> lie in the same part as <i>v</i>. 

We prove several results in this spirit: in particular, two of our results are that the majority colouring conjecture holds for Erdo&#779;s&ndash;Re&#x00301;nyi random directed graphs (of any density), and that the internal partition conjecture holds if we permit a tiny number of &ldquo;exceptional vertices&rdquo;. Our proofs involve a variety of techniques, including several different methods to analyse random recolouring processes.

<p>Recall the classical &ldquo;15 puzzle&rdquo;, consisting of 15 sliding blocks in a 4&times;4 grid. The configuration space of this puzzle consists of two connected components, corresponding to the odd and even permutations of the symmetric group <i>S</i><sub>15</sub>.

<p>Very sparse random graphs (and random bipartite graphs) are known to typically be singular (i.e., have singular adjacency matrix), due to the presence of &ldquo;low-degree dependencies&rdquo; such as isolated vertices and pairs of degree-1 vertices with the same neighbourhood. In this paper we give a combinatorial description of the rank of a sparse random graph &#x1D53E;(<i>n</i>,&#x202F;<i>c</i>/<i>n</i>) or &#x1D53E;(<i>n</i>,&#x202F;<i>n</i>,&#x202F;<i>c</i>/<i>n</i>), in terms of such local dependencies, for all constants <i>c</i>&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;e (and we present some evidence that the situation is very different for <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;e). This gives an essentially complete answer to a question of Vu, and has a number of applications including a central limit theorem for the rank of a sparse random graph.

<p>
For any constant <i>g</i>, we show that for sufficiently large <i>n</i> congruent to 1 or 3 (mod 6) there is an order-<i>n</i> Steiner triple system with girth at least <i>g</i>. This resolves an old conjecture of Erdo&#779;s.

<p>An <i>n</i>-vertex graph is called <em><i>C</i>-Ramsey</em> if it has no clique or independent set of size <i>C</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i> (i.e., if it has near-optimal
Ramsey behavior). In this paper we study edge-statistics in Ramsey graphs, obtaining very precise control of the distribution of the number of edges in a random vertex subset of a <i>C</i>-Ramsey graph. One of the consequences of our result is the resolution of an old conjecture of Erdo&#779;s and McKay. The proof proceeds via an &ldquo;additive structure&rdquo; dichotomy, and involves a wide range of different tools from
Fourier analysis, random matrix theory, the theory of Boolean functions, probabilistic combinatorics, and low-rank approximation.

<p>
We prove several theorems about substructures in Latin squares. First, we prove the first nontrivial lower bound on the number of the number of <i>n</i>&times;<i>n</i> Latin squares which have no <em>intercalates</em> (2&times;2 Latin subsquares). We also prove an essentially best-possible bound on the upper tail for intercalates in random Latin squares. Then, we prove a conjecture of Linial on the existence of Latin squares with high <em>girth</em>. Finally, we study the number of <em>cuboctahedra</em> in a random Latin square (this is a measure of &ldquo;how associative&rdquo; the quasigroup associated with the Latin square is).

<p>
Very sparse random graphs are known to typically be singular (i.e., have singular adjacency matrix), due to the presence of &ldquo;low-degree dependencies&rdquo; such as isolated vertices and pairs of degree-1 vertices with the same neighbour. We prove that these kinds of dependencies are in some sense the only causes of singularity: for any fixed <i>k</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3 and <i>c</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, a random graph with <i>n</i> vertices and edge probability <i>c</i>/<i>n</i> typically has the property that its <i>k</i>-core (its maximal subgraph with minimum degree at least <i>k</i>) is nonsingular. This resolves a conjecture of Vu, and adds to a very short list of nonsingularity theorems for &ldquo;extremely sparse&rdquo; random matrices with density <i>O</i>(1/<i>n</i>).

<p>
The <em>Littlewood&ndash;Offord problem</em> is concerned with upper bounds on probabilities of events of the form <i>a</i><sub>1</sub><i>&xi;</i><sub>1</sub>+...+<i>a<sub>n</sub>&xi;<sub>n</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>x</i>, where (<i>&xi;</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>&xi;<sub>n</sub></i>) is a random &plusmn;1 sequence and <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>a<sub>n</sub></i>,<i>x</i>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;&reals;<sup><i>d</i></sup> are vectors.

<p>
We show that the number of linear spaces on a set of <i>n</i> points and the number of rank-3 matroids on a ground set of size <i>n</i> are both of the form (<i>cn</i>+<i>o</i>(<i>n</i>))<sup><i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/6</sup>, for an explicit constant

<i>c</i>&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;0.162. This is the final piece of the puzzle for enumerating fixed-rank matroids at this level of accuracy: the numbers of rank-1 and rank-2 matroids on a ground set of size <i>n</i> have exact representations in terms of well-known combinatorial functions, and it was recently proved by van der Hofstad, Pendavingh and van der Pol that for constant <i>r</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;4 there are (e<sup>1&minus;<i>r</i></sup><i>n</i>+<i>o</i>(<i>n</i>))<sup><i>n</i><sup><i>r</i>&minus;1</sup>/<i>r</i>!</sup> rank-<i>r</i> matroids on a ground set of size <i>n</i>.

<p>
Resolving an old conjecture of Fu&#776;redi, we prove that, for <i>n</i> even, almost every <i>n</i>-vertex graph admits a partition of its vertex set into two parts of equal size in which almost all vertices have more neighbours on their own side than across. The proof relies on a new method to study stochastic processes driven by degree information in random graphs; this involves combining enumeration techniques with an abstract second moment argument.

<p>
For 1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>d</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>k</i> and <i>n</i> divisible by <i>k</i>, let <i>m</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>k</i>,&#x202F;<i>n</i>)
be the minimum <i>d</i>-degree ensuring the existence of a perfect matching
in a <i>k</i>-uniform hypergraph. In general, our understanding of the values of <i>m</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>k</i>,&#x202F;<i>n</i>)
is very limited, and it is an active topic of research to determine
or approximate these values. In this paper we prove a &ldquo;transference&rdquo;
theorem for random hypergraphs. Specifically,
for any 1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>d</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>k</i>, any  <i>&epsilon;</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 and any &ldquo;not too small&rdquo;
<i>p</i>, we prove that a random <i>k</i>-uniform hypergraph <i>G</i> with <i>n</i> vertices and edge probability <i>p</i> typically has the property that every spanning subgraph of <i>G</i> with minimum
degree at least (1+<i>&epsilon;</i>)&#x202F;<i>m</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>k</i>,&#x202F;<i>n</i>)&#x202F;<i>p</i>
has a perfect matching. One interesting aspect of our proof is a &ldquo;non-constructive&rdquo;
application of the absorbing method, which allows us to prove a bound
in terms of <i>m</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>(<i>k</i>,&#x202F;<i>n</i>) without actually knowing its
value.

<p>
Sometimes, it is possible to represent a complicated polytope as a &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; of a much simpler polytope. To quantify this phenomenon, the <em>extension complexity</em> of a polytope <i>P</i> is defined to be the minimum number of facets in a (possibly higher-dimensional) polytope from which <i>P</i> can be obtained as a linear projection. It is an important question to understand the extent to which the extension complexity of a polytope is controlled by its dimension, and in this paper we prove three different results along these lines. First, we show that there exists an <i>n</i><sup><i>o</i>(1)</sup>-dimensional polytope with at most <i>n</i> facets and extension complexity <i>n</i><sup>1&minus;<i>o</i>(1)</sup>. Second, we obtain optimal bounds for the extension complexity of random <i>d</i>-polytopes, and third, we obtain an optimal upper bound for the extension complexity of <em>cyclic</em> polygons (all of whose vertices lie on a common circle).

<p>
Consider a random <i>n</i>&times;<i>n</i> zero-one matrix with &ldquo;density&rdquo; <i>p</i>, sampled according to one of the following two models: either every entry is independently set to one with probability <i>p</i> (the &ldquo;Bernoulli&rdquo; model), or each row is independently uniformly sampled from the set of all length-<i>n</i> zero-one vectors with exactly <i>pn</i> ones (the &ldquo;combinatorial&rdquo; model). We give simple proofs of the (essentially best-possible) fact that in both cases, if min(<i>p</i>,1&#x202F;&minus;&#x202F;<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;(1+<i>&epsilon;</i>)&#x202F;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>&#x202F;/&#x202F;<i>n</i> for any constant &epsilon;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, then our random matrix is nonsingular with probability 1&#x202F;&minus;&#x202F;<i>o</i>(1).

<p>
A permutation is said to be <em><i>k</i>-universal</em> or a <em><i>k</i>-superpattern</em> if it contains every permutation of length <i>k</i>. A simple counting argument shows that every <i>k</i>-superpattern has length at least (1/<i>e</i><sup>2</sup>&#x202F;+&#x202F;<i>o</i>(1))&#x202F;<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>, and Arratia conjectured that this lower bound is best-possible. Disproving Arratia's conjecture, we improve this trivial bound by a small constant factor. We accomplish this by designing an efficient encoding scheme for the patterns that appear in a permutation. This approach is quite flexible and is applicable to other universality-type problems; for example, we also improve a bound by Engen and Vatter on a problem concerning (<i>k</i>+1)-ary sequences which contain all <i>k</i>-permutations.

a random permutation of length <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(1/4+<i>&epsilon;</i>)&#x202F;<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>
typically contains an increasing subsequence of length <i>k</i>. As a far-reaching
generalisation, Alon conjectured that a random permutation of this same length <i>n</i> is typically <em><i>k</i>-universal</em>, meaning that it simultaneously contains
every pattern of length <i>k</i>. He also made the simple observation
that some <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>O</i>(<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>&#x202F;log&nbsp;<i>k</i>) suffices.
In this paper we make the first asymptotic improvement to this bound: if <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2000&#x202F;<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>&#x202F;log&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>k</i>,
then a random permutation of order <i>n</i> is typically <i>k</i>-universal.

<p>How long a monotone path can one always find in any edge-ordering of the <i>n</i>-vertex complete graph? This question was first asked by Chva&#x00301;tal and Komlo&#x00301;s. The prevailing conjecture is that one can always find a monotone path of length &Omega;(<i>n</i>), but until now the best known lower bound was <i>n</i><sup>2/3&#x202F;&minus;&#x202F;<i>o</i>(1)</sup>. In this paper we prove that in any edge-ordering of the complete graph, there is a monotone path of length <i>n</i><sup>1&#x202F;&minus;&#x202F;<i>o</i>(1)</sup>. Our proof involves a &ldquo;regularisation&rdquo; lemma which may be of independent interest.

<p>
Consider a quadratic polynomial <i>f</i>(<i>&xi;</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>&xi;<sub>n</sub></i>) of independent Bernoulli random variables. What can be said about
the concentration of <i>f</i> on any single value? It is known that the point probabilities of <i>f</i> can be as large as about <i>n</i><sup>&minus;1/2</sup>, but still poorly understood is the &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; question of understanding how algebraic and arithmetic features of <i>f</i> affect its point probabilities. In this paper we prove some results
of an algebraic flavour, showing that if <i>f</i> has point probabilities
much larger than 1/<i>n</i> then it must be close to a quadratic form with low rank. We also give an application to Ramsey graphs.

<p>We show that for any <i>n</i> divisible by 3, almost all order-<i>n</i> Steiner triple systems have a perfect matching (also known as a <em>parallel class</em>). In fact, we prove a general upper bound on the number of perfect matchings in a Steiner triple system and show that almost all Steiner triple systems essentially attain this maximum. We accomplish this via a general theorem comparing a uniformly random Steiner triple system to the outcome of the triangle removal process, which we hope will be useful for other problems.

<p>An <em><i>r</i>-cut</em> of a <i>k</i>-uniform hypergraph (<i>k</i>-graph) <i>H</i> is a partition of the vertex set into <i>r</i> parts, and the <em>size</em> of such a cut is the number of edges which have a vertex from every part. The <em>max-<i>r</i>-cut</em> of <i>H</i> is the maximum size of an <i>r</i>-cut of <i>H</i>. We prove some new bounds on the max-<i>r</i>-cut of a <i>k</i>-graph, for fixed <!--3&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;--><i>r</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>k</i>, above the trivial &ldquo;average&rdquo; bound obtainable from a uniformly random cut. In particular, in contrast to the situation for max-cut in graphs and max-2-cut in 3-graphs, we show that if <i>k</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;4 or <i>r</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3 then the worst-case behaviour is not governed by the standard deviation of a uniformly random cut.

When <i>l</i> is zero or <span class="tall">(</span><span class="binom"><span class="top"><i>k</i></span><span class="fallback"> choose </span><span class="bottom">2</span></span><span class="tall">)</span>, this fraction can be exactly 1. On the other hand, with Ramsey's theorem in mind, if <i>l</i> is far from these extreme values we might expect that this fraction must always be substantially smaller than 1. We prove an almost-best-possible theorem to this effect, improving on results of Alon, Hefetz, Krivelevich and Tyomkyn. We also make some first steps towards some analogous questions for hypergraphs. Our proofs take a probabilistic point of view, and involve polynomial anticoncentration inequalities, hypercontractivity, and a coupling trick for random variables defined on a &ldquo;slice&rdquo; of the Boolean hypercube.

<p>We study the <em><i>k</i>-matching-free process</em>, where one starts with the empty <i>n</i>-vertex graph and adds edges one-by-one, each chosen uniformly at random subject to the constraint that no <i>k</i>-matching is created (for some <i>k</i> potentially depending on <i>n</i>). This appears to be the first analysis of an <i>H</i>-free process for non-fixed <i>H</i>. In our main theorems, we identify the range of <i>k</i> for which the process results in an extremal <i>k</i>-matching-free graph, as characterised by Erdo&#779;s and Gallai. One of the proofs involves some interesting coupling arguments for tracking the formation of augmenting paths.

<p>The classical Erdo&#779;s&ndash;Ko&ndash;Rado theorem gives the maximum size of a <i>k</i>-uniform intersecting family, and the Hilton&ndash;Milner theorem gives the maximum size of such a family that is not <em>trivially intersecting</em> (this means that there is no element <i>x</i> which appears in each set of the family). Frankl introduced and solved a certain natural &ldquo;multi-part&rdquo; generalization of the Erdo&#779;s&ndash;Ko&ndash;Rado problem; in this paper we study the corresponding question for non-trivially intersecting families.
